| R-004 | Playwright over Cypress | Better browser support, built-in visual testing, faster |
| R-005 | E2E testing in Phase 6 | Early investment before widget count grows |
| R-006 | Visual regression in Phase 7 | After coordinate system established; more visual complexity |
| R-007 | Coordinate system supports negative ranges | Parabolas extend below x-axis; roots can be negative |
| R-008 | Preset-based widgets (no arbitrary expressions) | Security, predictability, curated educational examples |
| R-009 | Complex roots link to Number Types | Educational progression without complex arithmetic on quadratics page |
| R-010 | Tiered CI workflow (Phase 9) | quick-check on push, full-test on PR only; balances speed and coverage |

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Scope creep | Each phase has ONE primary widget maximum |
| Content without interactivity | Every content section references widgets |
| Technical debt | Phase 6 includes explicit polish time |
| Mobile neglected | Phase 8 includes mobile optimization focus |
| Performance degradation | Phase 10 includes performance audit |
| Testing gaps | E2E added in Phase 6, before widget proliferation |
| Visual regressions | Screenshot testing added in Phase 7 |
| Statistics complexity | Four focused phases (17-20) with clear increments |
| Population grid performance | Virtualization for large N in Phase 18 |
