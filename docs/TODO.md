# SnakeMath ToDo List

**Last Updated**: 2026-01-19

## Current Status: Phase 21 Complete

Phase 21 (Integration/Integral Calculus) is complete. All major content sections are implemented.

See [CURRENT_STATE.md](CURRENT_STATE.md) for detailed project status and [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for future phases.

---

## Open Items

### Review Items

- [ ] **Code example repetition**: In `algebra/summation`, the same code example appears three times in quick succession; consolidate or differentiate

### Content Quality

- [ ] Ensure all topics have at least three analogies (1x everyday, 1x programming/system, 1x visual/intuitive)
- [ ] Ensure all mathematical terms are either explained or reference their explanation

---

## Future Ideas

### Widgets

- [ ] Interactive summation: Let users see how changing numbers in code maps to mathematical notation and vice versa
- [ ] Expression builder widget for Variables & Expressions page
- [ ] PEMDAS step-by-step calculator widget for Order of Operations page

### Content Enhancements

- [ ] Q&A section for each topic
- [ ] "Code Equivalent" sections for all relevant code examples (Python/JavaScript toggle)
- [ ] Write "for" in cursive to visually connect to for-loop concept
- [ ] Linear Algebra overview topic with Scalars, Vectors, Matrices, and Tensors
- [ ] Dedicated Tensor topic (Mathematical/Physics Tensor)
- [ ] Tensors in programming vs Mathematical/Physics Tensor
- [ ] Vector spaces, Rank, Covariance matrices (separate topic or integrate)
- [ ] Eigenvalues, Eigenvectors, and Eigen decomposition

### Site Features

- [ ] Tech stack section with "why" documentation (portfolio piece)
- [ ] SEO (meta tags, structured data, sitemap)

### Fun Ideas (On Hold)

- [ ] Snake Math Game: Navigate snake to correct answer (e.g., 81 + 7 = ? → find "88")
- [ ] Vectors and Matrices in n-th dimension
- [ ] Rename URL mapping between Vector 2D and Matrices 2D

## Analogies Bank

Collected analogies for future content:

- **Vector Spaces**: Vectors are like LEGO bricks. A vector space is the box of all possible structures you can build using certain types of bricks.
