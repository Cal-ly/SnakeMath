# CONTENT_OVERVIEW.md

This folder contains “content extraction” documents: lightweight subject overviews (where available) plus deeper planning docs for rewriting/porting archived content into SnakeMath’s current style.

Use this file as the map of what has been summarized so far, and where to look next.

---

## How to use these docs

- If you want the process/template: start with [CONTENT_WORKFLOW.md](./CONTENT_WORKFLOW.md).
- If you want quick “what should we teach?” subject summaries: start with [CONTENT_BASICS.md](./CONTENT_BASICS.md) and [CONTENT_ALGEBRA.md](./CONTENT_ALGEBRA.md).
- If you want implementation-ready rewrite plans (voice, pillars, exemplars, new examples, ordering): use the “Content Enhancement” planning docs listed below.

## Coverage checklist

Included in this overview:
- All `docs/content/CONTENT_*.md` files currently in the folder.

Not included on purpose:
- Any archive-only source markdown in `archive/snake-math/docs/**` (these overviews point to the extracted summaries/plans instead).
