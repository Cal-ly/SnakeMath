## Phase 6: Basics Completion + Testing Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETE

### Content (from archive) ✅
- [x] Functions (composition, inverse, vending machine analogy)
- [x] Variables and expressions (expression building, implementation methods)
- [x] Order of operations (PEMDAS, precedence tables, AST concepts)

### Testing Infrastructure ✅
- [x] Playwright setup and configuration
- [x] E2E tests for navigation
- [x] E2E tests for NumberTypeExplorer
- [x] E2E tests for SummationExplorer
- [x] Accessibility audit integration (axe-core)
- [x] CI workflow updates for E2E

## Phase 7: To Be Planned

*Next phase to be defined*

---

## Fixes (Known Issues)
- [ ] Algebra/Summation page jumps to top when recalculating (scroll position issue)

---

## Review
- Review what is collapsible and what is not. It is currently not being done in a standardized fashion.
- Review the usage of code examples. An example: In `algebra/summation` we have the same code example showing up three times in quick succession.

---

## Future Ideas
- Q&A section for each topic
- Tech stack "why" documentation (portfolio piece)
- Write "for" in cursive to visually connect to for-loop
- Add "Code Equivalent" to all/relevant code examples. Do it the same way, as been done in `algebra/summation`
- Make "Summation to code example" interactive. The idea is, that the user can see "I change this number, is equivalent to changing this number in the mathematical notation" and vice versa.
- Make it default behavior, that code examples that are not used directly in conveying the teaching material (e.g. "Code Equivalent" is directly used in conveying the content) collapsed.
- Expression builder widget for Variables & Expressions page
- PEMDAS step-by-step calculator widget for Order of Operations page
