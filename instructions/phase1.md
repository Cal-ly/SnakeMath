# Claude Code Instructions: Phase 1 - Project Scaffold

These instructions are designed to be given to Claude Code in VS Code. They are structured in increments as per my preferences.

## Increments Phase 1:
- Increment 1A: Project Initialization
- Increment 1B: Tailwind CSS Integration
- Increment 1C: Project Structure and Router Configuration
- Increment 1D: TypeScript Type Definitions
- Increment 1E: Vitest Configuration and Initial Tests
- Increment 1F: GitHub Pages Deployment Configuration
- Increment 1G: ESLint and Prettier Configuration Refinement

## Phase 1 Summary

After completing all increments, you'll have:

| Artifact | Purpose |
